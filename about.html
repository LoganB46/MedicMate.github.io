            Hello, Medicmate is a personal project I'm working on to bring important tools to the fingertips of emergency healthcare providers when they need it most. There will be bugs to this website, and I plan to keep them to a minimum and get them worked out as quickly as possible.
            I plan to keep adding more tools over time as they are requested. If you have any ideas, or see any bugs please let me know so I can make sure they are on the list of things to fix.

            Eventually I plan on having a Live and updating diversion status board, as well as a user login so other company specific things such as phone numbers and protocols can be added in the future.

        </p1>
